 #Before you Start:
1. the default shortcut for the Lunch-X is set as [Ctrl]+[G].You can change the shortcut as per you wish by going in the 'shortcut' setting in the 'settings' option in the menu bar of  Lunch-X.

2. To launch the Lunch-X for the first time you need to open the main folder, and double click the launch.exe file.

3. After doing that your shortcut will be active for the Launch-X.

4.If you quit the the script from the system tray option, the shortcut will be deactivated and for reactivation you will be required to repeat the second step.

5. If you want Lunch-X shortcut to be activated automatically whenever you start your system, you will  have to add the shortcut of 'launch.exe' file to the startup.

6. To learn how to add the shortcut to the startup you can refer to the 'help.txt' file in the main folder.

#Some words to say:
1.Launch-X is a customisable and direct to approach app scripted in autohotkey.

2. Some of the direct link (like notepad and calculator) are already added.

3. You can have your own shortcut button for the folder/file you open often, by the Add_New Button.
